Message from arpwatch-3.1:

--
You can create an ethercodes.dat file by running this script:

    /usr/local/arpwatch/update-ethercodes

Here's a example crontab entry to update it every night:

    00 0 * * * root sleep `jot -r 1 0 600` ; /usr/local/arpwatch/update-ethercodes

The -m flag is deprecated. If you are using the -m watcher flag,
please switch to -w.
>>> Cleaning up cache... done.
Success
```

As you can see the output shows an example of how to automatically update the ethercodes.
This file contains the mappings between mac address and vendors.

You can skip both `Install Cron` and `Setup Cron` if you do not want it to update automatically.
You can do it manual, by checking `Updates the ethernet vendor database` and clicking <kbd>💾Save</kbd>
