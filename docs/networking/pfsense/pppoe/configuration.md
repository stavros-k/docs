You might have to navigate to `System` -> `Routing` -> `Gateways`

And make sure there is only one gateway for the `WAN` interface. Mine is named `WAN_PPPOE`.

I had a faced a problem at some point, where there was more than one gateways.
It had something to do with how I had configured my WAN before.
Deleted the extra one, gone back to the interfaces we addded/edited,
hit <kbd>ðŸ’¾Save</kbd> one more time and everything worked.

Also, I had to set `Default gateway IPv4` to `WAN_PPPOE` <kbd>Save</kbd>
and reset it back to `Automatic` and <kbd>Save</kbd> again.
