:::warning Warning

Most of the XOA features (eg Scheduled Backups) require XOA to run continuously.
You cannot only use it to manage your VMs and then shut it down and
this should be considered when choosing the installation method.

:::

You can choose between 3 Methods to install XOA.

- [**Quick Deploy**](./quick), which spins a VM with limited available features
- [**Fast/Easy**](./fast), which downloads a pre-created VM that is build from source code and includes all features
- [**From source**](./source), which you manually download and install the OS and then run the installer to build XOA,
  this also includes all features
- [**Docker**](./docker), which you deploy a docker container with XOA, this also includes all features
