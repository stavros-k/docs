Installing XOA from source gives you all the pro features available.

## Create a VM

Follow the guide [here](../create-vm)

## Build XOA from source

For this method, to make it easier, follow first the `Quick Deploy` method, then come back here.

Navigate to `üè†Home` > `üñ•Ô∏èVMs`

- Click the `XOA` VM (with descriptions `XOA from Source`)
- Navigate to `Console`
- Run the following:

```shell
# Install git
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

# Clone the XOA Installer
git clone https://github.com/ronivay/XenOrchestraInstallerUpdater.git
cd XenOrchestraInstallerUpdater/

# Copy example config to a new file named xo-install.cfg
cp sample.xo-install.cfg xo-install.cfg

# Edit the config file (below you will find my sample)
nano xo-install.cfg

# Run the installation script (This will take a while)
sudo ./xo-install.sh --install
```

After the installer is finished, visit `https://<the.ip.ofyour.vm>`

Default credentials are:

- Username: `admin@admin.net`
- Password: `admin`
- Follow the [Quick Start](../setup-xoa.md) guide

:::note Note

This is how my xo-install.cfg looks like.
With this setup it will auto generate self signed certs and run on https
